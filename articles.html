                            After 6 dozens of months <br>
                             I finally reached for his letter <br>
                    One</p> he slid in my book <br>
                    One I swore to never read <br>
                    <br>
                   
                   </p> After 6 dozens of months <br>
                    I finally heard his words<br>
                    They echoed
                     so loud and deep<br>
                    Piercing the most secure walls<br>
                    Forcing tears out my dry eyes<br>
                    <br>
                    After 6 years of ignoring it<br>
                    I finally read his letter<br>
                    One he wrote his heart out<br>
                   <i> "You were never his...<br>
                    You were just a bet..."</i><br>
                    Words that came to life<br>
                    A few weeks after he wrote them
                    <br><br>
                    After 6 good years
                    <br>I'm here crying<br>
                    If I had only opened it<br>
                    My heart could have been saved<br>
                    Now more then ever,<br>
                    My heart is broken<br>
                    As his coffin was lowered this morning<br>

COULD HAVE, HAS NOT

My pen in my hand <br>
My brain in my head<br>
You in my arms<br>
That's the proper composition<br><br>

"Will you..." on my lips<br>
"Yes..." on your lips<br>
My palms on your hips<br>
That's how things should go<br><br>

Building a happy family together<br>
As we create enough room<br>
To raise a product of us, mating<br>
That was the original script<br><br>

A poem that will never be recited<br>
As I met you late<br>
Too bad, I'm not a cheater<br>
And my wife is not dying soon<br>
